# In-Class Coding: Testing, 1, 2, 3

As a quick practice run to test your VS Code and GitHub setup:
1. Accept the assignment and clone the repository in VS Code.
2. Add one thing in the HTML and one thing in the CSS.
3. Complete all Submission steps below.

## Submission
1. Make sure that your code is [formatted using the built-in formatting tools](https://ims322.ersheff.com/docs/style-guide.html#formatting).
2. In the Source Control panel of VS Code:
	1. Stage all changes by clicking the + next to Changes.
	2. Enter "finished" as a commit message and click the Commit button.
	3. The Commit button should change to a Sync Changes button. Click this to finish syncing the latest changes to your GitHub Repository.
3. Return to your assignment repository on GitHub.
	1. Go to Settings and navigate to the Pages section.
	2. Under Branch, choose "main" and click Save.
	3. After a few moments, if you refresh this page, there should now be a URL near the top next to a Visit Site button. If you click this button, you should see your site open in a new window.
4. Copy the URL generated by GitHub Pages, paste it in the Website URL field of the corresponding Canvas Assignment, and click Submit Assignment.
